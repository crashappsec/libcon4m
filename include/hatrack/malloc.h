// hatrack_malloc_t is the signature of a function that is used to allocate
// memory. The size is a minimum size; the function may return a larger size.
// The function must return a pointer that is 16-byte aligned. The returned
// pointer may be NULL if the requested allocation cannot be satisfied.

// hatrack_realloc_t is the signature of a function that is used to resize an
// existing allocation. The old pointer and size are always provided (oldptr
// will never be NULL). The new size functions the same as with the memory
// allocation function. Likewise, the returned pointer must be 16-byte aligned.
// The returned pointer may be the same as the old pointer as long as it
// satisfies the new size requirement. The caller will assume that the original
// pointer is no longer valid. It is this function's responsibility to copy the
// memory from the old pointer to the new pointer, as appropriate. The returned
// pointer may be NULL if the requested allocation cannot be satisfied. In this
// case the original pointer remains valid.
